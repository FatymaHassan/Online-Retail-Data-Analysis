This online-Retail-Data-Analysis series walks through step by step process of how to understanding customer behavior, and developing strategic business decisions. It is a valuable asset for both commercial and academic pursuits in the field of data analysis and business intelligence

I will cover  during this project almost all data science concepts such as Importing Libraries: Essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported ,data load , data Cleaning and Preprocessing ,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) , Data visualizations and Linear regression model

Technology and tools wise this project covers

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib  & seaborn for data visualization
4. Linear regression for model building
5. Jupyter notebookas IDE
